# PS script to List Billing Accounts using Rest API

Script Overview and Pre-requisites
 
 This sample script invokes the REST API directly to List the Billing Accounts from PowerShell.
 Before running this, One has to go to `Cost Management + Billing` blade in Azure Portal --> `Billing Scopes` --> Select any billing account --> Access Control blade IAM to grant any one permissions to view billing accounts.
 Remember that a Billing Reader, itâ€™s a permissions available at Subscription scope. Once a user grants this permission, they will be able to download or manage only invoices of the subscription (below), not the billing accounts.
 The permissions needed to view the billing account is different from the permissions to control at subscription. BillingReader or any custom role is a RBAC permission on Subscription scope and they have no significance or impact on controlling/managing billing accounts.
 Update all the variable details in the below code before running the sample.
